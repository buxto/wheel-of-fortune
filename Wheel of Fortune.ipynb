    "    HOW TO PLAY:\n",
    "    This game has 3 players who take turns spinning a wheel which has 24 slices.\n",
    "    The slices can be monetary values ranging from $100 - $900, or titled\n",
    "    LOSE A TURN or BANKRUPT. Both cause you to lose your turn, but the\n",
    "    BANKRUPT slice also makes you lose any money you've accrued.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    The objective of the game is to earn money by guessing letters out of the selected word.\n",
    "    When a player lands on a money slice, they have the opportunity to earn that much money\n",
    "    by correctly guessing a consonant that appears in the blanked out word. If they succeed,\n",
    "    they can also buy a vowel for $250. After that, they can try to guess the word and by doing\n",
    "    so, they are able to keep all the money they've accrued for the next rounds. The other players\n",
    "    are reset to $0.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    STANDARD ROUND:\n",
    "    The rules above apply for the two standard rounds. The player who guesses the word retains the money\n",
    "    they've earned, while the other two players are reset back to $0. The player who has the highest\n",
    "    total earned moves onto the final round.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    FINAL ROUND:\n",
    "    In the final round, there is only one player and the rules are quite different. A word is picked and\n",
    "    the letters R, S, T, L, N and E are revealed for free. The player still standing at this stage can\n",
    "    guess 3 consonants and 1 vowel. Once this is all done, the player must guess the word to earn the\n",
    "    money they accrued over the previous two rounds. If they get it wrong, they get nothing.\n",
